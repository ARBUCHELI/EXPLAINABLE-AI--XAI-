* What is Explainable AI?
-------------------------
Learn about Explainable AI and its importance in understanding the inner workings of deep learning systems.

Key ideas:

	. Explainable AI (XAI) is a set of techniques used to make the inner workings of deep learning systems transparent and understandable to humans.
	----------------

	. Some AI algorithms, like decision trees, are called inherently explainable. Due to their structure, it is possible (at least in theory) for human experts to understand how these 
	algorithms make decisions.

	. Other AI algorithms, like deep neural networks, are inherently opaque. Sometimes called black boxes, these algorithms can be highly effective, but it is usually very hard to 
	understand how they are working.

	. The goal of Explainable AI is to make black boxes into glass boxes, providing transparency into the decision-making process of deep learning systems.

Question: why do you think we care about explainability at all, if the algorithms work?

	. Imagine an algorithm being used to diagnose a medical condition. A human doctor has all sorts of factors that influence their decision, including judgement calls like "better to 
	err on the side of caution." If we want the algorithm to do the same, we need to know how the algorithm is making its decisions!

	. Algorithms are also only as good as their data. If the data being fed into the algorithm is biased, the algorithm may reproduce that bias. Medical datasets, for example, often 
	don't contain the same amount or quality of data for different types of bodies. So our medical diagnostic algorithm may be influenced by biases in its dataset. Without knowing how 
	it is making decisions, we will have a much harder time correcting for these issues.
